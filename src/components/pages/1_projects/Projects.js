Our rover will exhibit four distinct competencies: (1) computer vision algorithms for object avoidance and extreme terrain navigation, (2) object retrieval and delivery mechanisms to support mission objectives, (3) remote-controlled robotic arm that can perform complex maintenance operations on an equipment system, and (4) science system to collect samples and detect signs of life. We intend to compete in the <a href="https://urc.marssociety.org/home">University Rover Challenge</a>, hosted annually in May in Utah. <p>* Rover is becoming its own club starting Fall 2024. </p>'
